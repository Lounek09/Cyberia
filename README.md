## Setup

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure is tailored to my specific use case. Feel free to setup the application in any way that suits you.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- **.NET**: [Install .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux)
- **Cyberia.Cdn**: Follow the [Cyberia.Cdn setup](https://github.com/Lounek09/Cyberia.Cdn#setup)
- **Caddy**: [Install Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install)

### Installation Steps

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> From this point forward, I will assume that all steps from the Cyberia.Cdn setup have been completed.

1. **Build the project:**
   You have two options for building the project: manually from the server or by setting up the publish action in your fork.
   - **Manual Build:**
     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:Lounek09/Cyberia.git
     cd Cyberia
     dotnet build Cyberia/Cyberia.csproj -c Release -o output
     mv output /var/www/cyberia/App
     ```
   - Setup the publish action in your fork:
     You will need to configure four secrets in your GitHub repository settings:
     - **SSH_HOST** - The ip of your server
     - **SSH_KEY** - Your private SSH key configured for your user
     - **SSH_PORT** - The port of your SSH
     - **SSH_USER** - The user it will connect to  
     After configuring these secrets, you can manually trigger the publish action by following [GitHub's guide on manually running a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow).

2. **Configure Caddy:**
   Edit the Caddy configuration file `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` to include the following block. Replace *your-domain.com* with your actual domain:
   ```caddy
   your-domain.com {
     import common
   
     reverse_proxy :5009
     encode gzip
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Caddy:**  
   Restart the Caddy service to apply the new configuration[^1]:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart caddy
   ```

[^1]: If the service fails to start due to missing permissions, it's likely because Caddy creates certain directories without the correct permissions. Try the following command after each restart until it works: `sudo chmod -R 755 /var/lib/caddy/.local`
